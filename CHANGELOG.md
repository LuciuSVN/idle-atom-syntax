# 2019.1
Added support for Python via [MagicPython].

MagicPython is supported over the core `language-python` as it provides better
highlighting.  In particular, it supports newer features and is more in-tune
with Python 3 (for example, `print` is not a keyword).  If you use Atom for
Python development, I wholeheartedly recommend MagicPython.
