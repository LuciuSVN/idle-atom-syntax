# Idle Atom
A (non-straight) port of the IDLE New theme to Atom.

![The theme in action.](screenshot.png)

<sup>The font used is Consolas.  The code is from the Python standard library
`datetime` module.</sup>

The theme supports all languages, but pretty terribly.  The theme is currently
only optimised for Python (specifically [MagicPython], YMMV for other packages,
including `language-python`).
